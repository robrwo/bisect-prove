REQUIREMENTS

SYNOPSIS
      $ git bisect start
      $ git bisect good 12345678
      $ bisect-prove -lr t/

DESCRIPTION
    This script is a wrapper around prove that uses `git-bisect' to search
    for the first commit that causes tests to fail.

    All options are passed to the `prove' command.

    If you wish to see the output of `git-bisect', run the program with the
    `BISECT_PROVE' variable set, e.g.

      BISECT_PROVE=1 bisect-prove -lr t/

    Note that you do not need to be in the toplevel directory to run, but
    this asusmes that the current directory is present in every commit.

SEE ALSO
    * prove

    * git-bisect
