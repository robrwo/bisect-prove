=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ git bisect start
  $ git bisect good 12345678
  $ bisect-prove -lr t/

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is a wrapper around L<prove> that uses C<git-bisect> to
search for the first commit that causes tests to fail.

All options are passed to the C<prove> command.

If you wish to see the output of C<git-bisect>, run the program with
the C<BISECT_PROVE> variable set, e.g.

  BISECT_PROVE=1 bisect-prove -lr t/
